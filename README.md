**App Idea: Wardrobe Master**
- App designed to save time in making choices about what clothes to wear each day. Considers factors like outside temperature, location (home or school), mood (aided by user input), and outfit history (what clothes you chose to wear on a particular day in the past) to suggest a pair/ pairs of clothes to wear. Uses AI to create an image of you wearing the clothes so that you get a sense of how you'll look before actually wearing them. Suggestions are based on clothes that are actually in your wardrobe but can also make shopping suggestions or dress you in clothes options you provide as images. The app will also include a feature for sharing potential outfits with friends/family for feedback. Not only will using Wardrobe Master save time in selecting outfit but will also save money by allowing you to make full use of your wardrobe and wear good clothes that are sometimes hidden and forgotten, reducing the need to buy new ones.
  
## Notes

- Faced challenges with installing iOS17 for the simulator; the software would install but not run. Solved this issue by clearing out more space
- Had trouble opening the storyboard file. Following the GIF provided was helpful in finding a leeway to the issue
- Recording a GIF using LICEcap after creating the project proved to be a challenge. Realized I had mistakenly denied the app permission to record the screen; changing permissions in system settings solved the issue
