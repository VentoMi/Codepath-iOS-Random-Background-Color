## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

- Faced challenges with installing iOS17 for the simulator; the software would install but not run. Solved this issue by clearing out more space
- Had trouble opening the storyboard file. Following the GIF provided was helpful in finding a leeway to the issue
- Recording a GIF using LICEcap after creating the project proved to be a challenge. Realized I had mistakenly denied the app permission to record the screen; changing permissions in settings solved the issue
